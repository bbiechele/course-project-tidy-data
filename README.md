# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The included "run_analysis.R" script:

-   downloads the raw dataset,

-   merges several raw text files into a new merged file that contains the activity and associated measurements of 30 subjects during both training and testing of wearable devices (gyro, accelerometer), and

-    creates a new, tidy dataset called "tidy_dataset.txt" that contains the mean of each measurement grouped by subject and activity (sitting, walking, etc.)
